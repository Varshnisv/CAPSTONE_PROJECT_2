# CAPSTONE_PROJECT_2 PLAY STORE REVIEW ANALYSIS
This is my capstone project for Module-2. Topic name is Google play-store review analysis

**Overview**
This Project examines information from the Google Play Store to identify the major elements driving app engagement and success. The research seeks to give developers with practical information for capturing the Android app market by optimising factors such as app ratings, size, reviews, and more.

The project investigates and visualises the link between various app features and success measures (such as ratings and reviews) in order to make data-driven suggestions.

**The project makes use of two primary datasets:**

1.Apps Data from the Google Play Store: This dataset includes details about the apps, including size, number of installs, category, rating, and more.

2.User reviews from the Google Play Store: This dataset includes comments and opinions left by users regarding the apps.

**Goal**
This analysis's objective is to:

Learn about the trends and patterns that affect the success and engagement of apps.
Determine the most important elements that developers should concentrate on to enhance the Play Store performance of their app.
Instruments and Reference Materials

**The following Python libraries are utilised by the project:**

Pandas: For aggregating, cleaning, and manipulating data.
For variable relationship analysis and visualisation, use Matplotlib with Seaborn.
NumPy: For manipulating arrays and performing efficient numerical calculations.

**Significant  Visualization**
At least five distinct visualisations that examine the connection between app features and success are included in the investigation. Among these visualisations are the following:

Distribution of app ratings by category: Rating Distribution.
Category vs. Installs: This section examines the connection between an app's category and install count.
App size and rating: An analysis of the relationship between the two.
Sentiment analysis provides information about user opinions and how they affect ratings.
pricing vs. Rating: Examining the relationship between pricing and the app's success and rating.

**Conclusions and Suggestions**
Category: Higher ratings and installs are linked to certain categories, such as "Games" and "Communication".
Size: Compared to extremely huge or tiny apps, medium-sized apps often receive higher scores.
Price: Positive evaluations for free applications are more common than for premium apps.
Sentiment: Positive reviews are strongly correlated with high ratings for apps, highlighting the significance of user input.

**In summary**
This research identifies a number of crucial elements that affect an app's chances of success in the Google Play Store. Developers may optimise their app offers and increase user engagement by paying attention to these facts and making well-informed decisions.
